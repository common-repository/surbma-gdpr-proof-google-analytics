### Features in details

#### Simple Cookie Policy popup
If you don't have such cookies on your website, that need visitor consent, you can use this plugin as a simple Cookie Policy popup, so you can inform your visitors about the cookies you use. It will show your informations in a beautiful popup and a link to your Cookie Policy page.

#### Hide Decline button
If you only want to show the Accept button, you can hide the Decline button.

#### Cookie-Free Social Share Buttons
You can add Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest and Email Share Buttons to posts, pages or even custom post types. These share buttons are loading really fast (almost 0 impact in page load time) and they are not using any Cookies on your website. So you can exclude social sharing topic from your Cookie Policy page. Choose if you want to show the buttons before or after the content or both positions. There are pre-defined styles to choose from, but Social Share Buttons can easily changed via CSS.

There is a shortcode also for the social share buttons, that can be used anywhere on your website:

	`[surbma-social-buttons]`

#### Cookie Scan page
This page will display all the saved cookies for you, so you can see, what cookies are used in your website.

#### Live Cookie Scan shortcode
You can display all the actual Cookies, a visitor has right now. It is not a full list of Cookies, that your website is using!

This is the shortcode: `[surbma-live-cookie-scan]`

**It has 1 attribute:**

cookievalue - Show or hide the Cookie values in the list.

**Example:**

    `[surbma-live-cookie-scan cookievalue="false"]`

#### Cookie Settings Link
There is a shortcode, that will place a link in your content. Clicking on the link will open the Cookie Popup again, and users can change their settings about the Cookie trackings.

This is the shortcode: `[surbma-cookie-popup-link]`

**It has 2 attributes:**

class - You can set the class of the link, so you can easily create a button like link.
text - You can change the default text of the link, which is "Open Cookie Settings".

**Examples:**

    `[surbma-cookie-popup-link text="I've changed my mind about Cookie settings."]`
    `[surbma-cookie-popup-link class="button" text="Please show me the Cookie settings again!"]`

#### Cookie Policy
Set your Cookie Policy page, where the popup won't load for visitors. Cookie tracking codes are not loading on this page!

#### Developer Friendly
If you enable debug mode, popup will show always, on every refresh, so you can test how it works.

#### WPML & Polylang Compatible
If you have a multilingual website, you can set the texts for each language with WPML String Translation add-on.

#### Snackbar before Popup
Modest Snackbar before Popup display, so the first time is not that aggressive. The link in the Snackbar opens the Popup. Choose between 6 positions to show the Snackbar.

#### Full Customizations
Every text is customizable, even the button's texts! You can also set the design of the buttons.

#### Cookie Policy Link
Show your Cookie Policy page link in the popup.

#### Popup Styles
There are popup styles to choose the look and feel of the popup: Default, Almost Flat and Gradient. Fit the style to your website easily.

#### Popup Themes
There are popup themes to choose the design, you like. The Full Page Themes are hiding the entire content behind the popup. There are a lot of design settings to make the popup fit your website design. Dark mode is also available.

#### Full Cookie Control
Set cookie expiration for visitors, so the popup won't show again in X days, you set.

#### Google Analytics IP Anonymization
You might need to disable IP Anonymization of the hit sent to Google Analytics. This setting is active by default to ensure the maximum GDPR compliance, but you can disable this option.

#### Google Analytics Tracking Code Customizations
Choose between gtag.js framework or analytics.js library. You can also set, if you want to track logged in users or the admin area.

#### Facebook Pixel Customer Identifiers Settings
Add Facebook Pixel Customer Identifiers to your Facebook Pixel code. Improve the ability to match site visitors to people on Facebook by passing additional site visitor information (such as email address or phone number).
